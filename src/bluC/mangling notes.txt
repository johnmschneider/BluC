1) ALL FUNCTIONS MUST CONTAIN MANGLED TYPE INFORMATION, REGARDLESS OF IF THEY 
    ARE OVERLOADED.
1-1) This is to detect incompatible ABIs at link-time (for example, if a
    function was added or removed).
1-2) This includes both return type information as well as paremeter type 
    information

2) NAMES OF PARAMETERS must be included in the mangling
2-1) This is also to detect incompatible apis, but ones whose abi break is not
    detectable by just the function signature.

3) all BluC libraries will have a global function named
    "___bluC[separator][libMangle][separator]getExportedSymbols" which lists all
    the mangled symbols exported by the library.
